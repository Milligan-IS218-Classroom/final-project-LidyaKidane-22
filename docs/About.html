                 <p> HI! Im Lidya Kidane and Im orginally from Ethiopia and I have four others siblings which are all boys. I know its kinda rough being an only girl but I wouldnt have it any other way. I have been attending Milligan University for two years. I transfered from Highlands Community college in Bristol Virginia. I hope that I will learn how to build my own business and be able to create my own website through my major one day.  </p>
